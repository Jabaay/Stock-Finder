This summer I will be a PML Intern in Textronâ€™s IT Leadership Development program allowing me to better understand not only Product Management as a whole but what it is like to work in industry. I have taken many classes here at Miami University learning important tools for the future such as Java, C++, R, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Agile Frameworks, the product management lifecycle, and many other frameworks and libraries. For CSE 383 I have had to be a quick learner pulling in previous knowledge in order to pick up fun and new skills. Overall, I have had a great time learning new languages, libraries, frameworks, and other web applications.";

I am an active member in Miami University's pool club, joining my friends in order to play and practice at least once a week. Another hobby that I participate in is motorcycle riding! It is my favorite thing to do in the summer, feeling the breeze as I ride down the road and hanging out with and meeting new friends is always something that I enjoy doing. Recently I have been getting more involved with playing pickleball which has been an interesting game to learn. While fun, I still believe that I enjoy playing tennis more. Overall I believe that any hobby outdoors is for me, but the hobby that I am looking forward to getting into the most is drone flying which I hope to learn more about this summer.";

I am hopeful that the more I explore the world and its people the more that I can find something that sticks out to me as a passion that I can use to help others and make the lives of those in need easier while allowing me to continue to live a life of exploration, learning and teaching.
